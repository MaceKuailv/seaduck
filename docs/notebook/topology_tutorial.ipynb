    "In the movie \"Kill Bill\", all the brutal action happens after the main character wakes up from a coma and manages to \"wiggle your big toe\". In a similar way, all the functionality of `seaduck` depends on the `Topology` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name \"topology\" suggests, this object describes how the grids are connected in the horizontal dimensions. This is a simple compact model with high performance. It is also designed with expandability in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any grid configuration not yet supported by this package, only one function must be added to the code, and, with no (or at least, very little) extra effort, this module (and therefore the entire package) should work for the new configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magic function is simply: Given a center grid point and its index, if you one want to step one grid point to the up/down/left/right what would the new index be?\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it."
