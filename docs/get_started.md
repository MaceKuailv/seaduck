# Get started

For a extremely quick start, read this [one minute guide](./one_min_guide.md). Or, learn about how the objects and functions are related to each other [here](./network_of_object.md).

If you have questions about any function, you can always go to [API references](./api_reference.md). Or you could checkout the following examples. More example can be found [here](ideal_test.md) and [here](ocean_example.md)
