# Plot the streamlines on LLC4320

Author: Wenrui Jiang 14 June, 2023
> **Warning**⚠️ : the notebook was last ran on **2023-06-15** with **seaduck 0.1.3.dev44+g8d60702**. You can find the executable version at https://github.com/MaceKuailv/seaduck_sciserver_notebook/blob/master/LLC4320.ipynb.
LLC4320 is a kilometer scale global simulation with complex grid topology. This is a good test for the performance of the package.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cartopy.crs as ccrs
from tqdm import tqdm
import numpy as np
from matplotlib.collections import LineCollection
import matplotlib as mpl
import oceanspy as ospy

import seaduck as sd

mpl.rcParams["figure.dpi"] = 600
```

## Calculate the streamlines online

First we get the dataset into `OceData` object with help from `OceanSpy`. This step require the grid to be loaded into memory as numpy arrays and creating the cKD tree on top of that, so it is going to take some time.

```{code-cell} ipython3
od = ospy.open_oceandataset.from_catalog("LLC4320")
ds = od._ds
oce = sd.OceData(ds)
```

Initiate the particles randomly so that they are distributed evenly on the globe.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

N = int(1.5e5)
np.random.seed(4320)
xx, yy, zz = [np.random.normal(size=N) for i in range(3)]
r = np.sqrt(xx**2 + yy**2 + zz**2)
y = (np.pi / 2 - np.arccos(zz / r)) * 180 / np.pi
x = np.arctan2(yy, xx) * 180 / np.pi
x = x[y > -80]
y = y[y > -80]
z = np.ones_like(x) * (-10.0)
t = np.ones_like(x) * 10.0

ax = plt.axes(
    projection=ccrs.Orthographic(central_longitude=-20.0, central_latitude=45.0)
)
ax.plot(x, y, "o", markersize=0.1, transform=ccrs.PlateCarree())
ax.coastlines()
plt.show()
```

We will be using just one vertical layer of a single snapshot in the output to make the streamlines.

```{code-cell} ipython3
oce["u"] = oce["U"][0, 0]
oce["v"] = oce["V"][0, 0]
```

By setting `wname = None`, we create a particle moving in the 2D mode.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
p = sd.Particle(
    x=x,
    y=y,
    z=z,
    t=t,
    data=oce,
    uname="u",
    vname="v",
    wname=None,
)
```

The package knows that LLC4320 is a large dataset, so it is not prefetching data to not overwhelm itself.

In general, this is a smart thing to do. However, since we are using the 2D velocity, which is much smaller than all the component, we actually have enough memory for prefetching. We can manually change that by:

```{code-cell} ipython3
p.too_large = False
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
p.uarray = np.array(oce["u"])
p.varray = np.array(oce["v"])
```

Everything went well. Now, we are going to run it with 3 hour timestep for 30 days.

```{code-cell} ipython3
step = 10800
N = 240
dest = [n * step for n in range(1, N)]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%time
stops, raw = p.to_list_of_time(dest, update_stops=[])
```

It took around 3 hours to run a month of simulation for $1.5\times 10^{5}$ particles. We can now extract the things we need to plot, namely longitude, latitude, and horizontal speed.

```{code-cell} ipython3
lons = np.array([i.lon for i in raw])
lats = np.array([i.lat for i in raw])
spds = np.array([np.hypot(i.u * i.dx, i.v * i.dy) for i in raw])
```

If you would like to save the data for plotting, you can change the following raw block to code block and run it.

```{raw-cell}
np.save('LLC4320lons.npy',lons)
np.save('LLC4320lats.npy',lats)
np.save('LLC4320spds.npy',spds)
```

If the location and speed is already pre-computed, they can be loaded by:

```{raw-cell}
lons = np.load('LLC4320lons.npy')
lats = np.load('LLC4320lats.npy')
spds = np.load('LLC4320spds.npy')
```

## Plotting Preparation

The ETOPO topography data set is also accessible on sciserver using `OceanSpy`. This will give us absolutely beautiful plots.

```{code-cell} ipython3
etopo = ospy.open_oceandataset.from_catalog("ETOPO")
```

For this notebook, we only need the over sea level part, because there is already so much going on in the water.

```{code-cell} ipython3
etopo = etopo._ds.where(etopo._ds.Depth > 0)
```

Here is the function for plotting. The lines will have use speed as colormaps. This part is going to take some time, but I hope you find it worth the wait.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def pretty_stream_plot(
    lats,
    lons,
    spds,
    projection,
    particle_bins=1,
    bins=5,
    north=1000,
    south=-1000,
    plot_lines=True,
    save_as=None,
):
    plt.figure(figsize=(16, 16))
    axs = plt.axes(projection=projection)
    axs.set_extent([-1e4, 1e4, south, north], crs=ccrs.PlateCarree())
    plt.tight_layout()
    axs.pcolormesh(
        etopo.X[::bins],
        etopo.Y[::bins],
        etopo.Depth[::bins, ::bins],
        transform=ccrs.PlateCarree(),
        cmap="bone",
        vmin=-3000,
        vmax=4500,
        zorder=20,
    )
    axs.set_facecolor("lightsteelblue")
    print("finished making the map")
    if not plot_lines:
        print("skipping the lines")
        return
    # To speed up the computation, we transform the
    # latlon outside the for plotting for-loop.
    xx, yy, _ = projection.transform_points(ccrs.PlateCarree(), lons, lats).T

    xx = xx.T
    yy = yy.T

    for i in tqdm(range(0, lons.shape[1], particle_bins)):
        y = yy.T[i][1:]
        x = xx.T[i][1:]
        if np.max(x) - np.min(x) > 300:
            x[x < 0] += 360
        dydx = (0.5 * (spds.T[i][:-1] + spds.T[i][1:]))[1:]  # first derivative

        # Create a set of line segments so that we can color them individually
        # This creates the points as a N x 1 x 2 array so that we can stack points
        # together easily to get the segments. The segments array for line collection
        # needs to be (numlines) x (points per line) x 2 (for x and y)
        points = np.array([x, y]).T.reshape(-1, 1, 2)

        segments = np.concatenate([points[:-1], points[1:]], axis=1)

        # Create a continuous norm to map from data points to colors
        norm = plt.Normalize(0, 1.0)
        lc = LineCollection(segments, cmap="GnBu_r", norm=norm)
        # Set the values used for colormapping
        lc.set_array(dydx)
        lc.set_linewidth(0.3)
        axs.add_collection(lc)

    if save_as is not None:
        plt.savefig(save_as)
```
