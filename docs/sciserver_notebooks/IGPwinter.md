> **Warning**⚠️ : the notebook was last ran on **2023-07-06** with **seaduck 0.1.dev433+g99d4d3b**. You can find the executable version at https://github.com/MaceKuailv/seaduck_sciserver_notebook/blob/master/IGPwinter.ipynb.

```{admonition} Access IGPwinter
The regional MITgcm run is the IGPwinter simulation and is publicly available on [SciServer](sciserver.org) (from the Oceanography container). The simulation output can be opened using the [OceanSpy](https://github.com/hainegroup/oceanspyhttps://github.com/hainegroup/oceanspy) package using the [`from_catalog`](https://oceanspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/oceanspy.open_oceandataset.from_catalog.html#oceanspy.open_oceandataset.from_catalog) method.

`ecco = ospy.open_oceandataset.from_catalog("IGPwinter")`

We're going to artificially create an open boundary in depth. This is to demonstrate that there's no weird behavior associated with open vertical boundaries.

```{code-cell} ipython3
ds = od._ds.isel(Z=slice(0, 50), Zl=slice(0, 50))
```

## Prepare the simulation

Since this notebook works with an open domain (regional model, not global), it's going to differ a bit from other `seaduck` notebooks.

We're interested in looking at the coastal current. First, we need to prepare a `seaduck.OceData` object...

```{code-cell} ipython3
oce = sd.OceData(ds)
```

...Initialize the particles: We put the ducks on the East Greenland continental shelf...

```{code-cell} ipython3
Nx = 20
Nz = 10
x = np.linspace(-22, -20, Nx)
z = np.linspace(0, -200, Nz)
x, z = np.meshgrid(x, z)
x = x.ravel()
z = z.ravel()
y = np.ones_like(x) * 71.0
```

...and at the beginning of the simulation...

```{code-cell} ipython3
start_time = "2018-01-02"
t = np.ones_like(x) * sd.utils.convert_time(start_time)
```

...and integrate forward in time for one month (the actual trajectory calculation is made below; this is just setting parameters).

```{code-cell} ipython3
end_time = "2018-02-01"
tf = sd.utils.convert_time(end_time)
```

### Here is where the particles start on the map:

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.pcolormesh(ds["XC"], ds["YC"], np.log10(ds["Depth"] + 10), cmap="Blues")
plt.plot(x, y, "r")
cb = plt.colorbar(label="Depth(m)")
cbar_depth = np.concatenate([np.arange(0, 500, 100), np.arange(500, 4000, 500)])
cb.ax.set_yticks(np.log10(cbar_depth + 10), cbar_depth, fontsize=6)
plt.xlabel("Longitude")
plt.ylabel("Latitude")
plt.title("Bathymetry of model domain and particle initial position")
plt.show()
```

**Fig.1** The initial position of the particles released (red line) on a horizontal map of the surrounding regions.

We are going to follow a cold puff of fresh water near the Greenland shelf. Since we have `OceanSpy` installed here at SciServer, let me quickly show you how to make a vertical section of this region. (It really takes no effort at all!)

```{code-cell} ipython3
od_surv = od.subsample.survey_stations(
    Xsurv=[-22.0, -19.0], Ysurv=[71.0, 71.0], delta=1
)
od_surv._ds = od_surv._ds.isel(time=0)
od_surv.plot.vertical_section(varName="Temp", contourName="Sigma0")
plt.ylim([-750, 0])
plt.show()
```

**Fig.2** Vertical section at 71N. This vertical section goes a little further east than the initial particle positions to include the shelf break. Colors denotes the potential temperature, while the contours are the potential density anomaly calculated using OceanSpy (with the equation of state the model used).

Since we are in an open domain (in all three dimensions), given long enough time, some particles will leave the domain. This will jeopardise the entire simulation!  We can define a callback function to stop that from happening.

If provided, the function will be called every time particles cross walls. It can be used to manipulate the particles and catch the out-of-domain issue. But here we just use it as a stop/continue criterion.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def continue_criterion(pt):
    x_ = np.logical_and(pt.lon < -10, pt.lon > -35)
    y_ = np.logical_and(pt.lat < 72, pt.lat > 65)
    z_ = pt.dep > -750
    return np.logical_and(np.logical_and(x_, y_), z_)
```

This time we are going to use volume flux (transport) to advect the particles. This is usually better than using the velocity field itself.

```{code-cell} ipython3
oce["utrans"] = oce["U"] * oce["drF"] * oce["dyG"]
oce["vtrans"] = oce["V"] * oce["drF"] * oce["dxG"]
oce["wtrans"] = oce["W"] * oce["rA"]
```

Finally, create the particle object:

```{code-cell} ipython3
p = sd.Particle(
    x=x,
    y=y,
    z=z,
    t=t,
    data=oce,
    callback=continue_criterion,
    uname="utrans",
    vname="vtrans",
    wname="wtrans",
    # save_raw = True,
    transport=True,
)
```

## Perform the particle trajectory simulation

Run the simulation!  This can take some time, so grab a break...

```{code-cell} ipython3
stops, raw = p.to_list_of_time([t[0], tf])
```

Retrieve the particle positions from the `seaduck.eulerian.position` objects.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

lons = np.array([pt.lon for pt in raw])
lats = np.array([pt.lat for pt in raw])
```

### Plot results

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

plt.pcolormesh(od._ds["XC"], od._ds["YC"], np.log10(od._ds["Depth"] + 10), cmap="Blues")
plt.plot(x, y, "r")
plt.plot(lons, lats, "gold", lw=0.5)
plt.xlim([-35, -10])
plt.ylim([65, 72])
plt.xlabel("Longitude")
plt.ylabel("Latitude")
plt.title("Particle trajectories overlaid on bathymetry map")
plt.show()
```

**Fig.3** The particle trajectories overlaid on **Fig.1**. The color scheme for bathymetry is the same as **Fig.1**.

```{code-cell} ipython3
